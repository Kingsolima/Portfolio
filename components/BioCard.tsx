        <p>
          I'm a 19-year-old founder, AI developer, and venture analyst building at the intersection of product, deep tech, and design. I'm currently pursuing a double degree in Computer Science and (hopefully) Business, where I'm blending engineering with entrepreneurshipâ€”one prototype, pitch, and launch at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm spending this summmer building tools powered by LLMs, deploying MVPs like <strong>VC Evaluator</strong> (a GPT-powered due diligence tool about to be used by my firm). I intern at <strong>Zweelie</strong>, where I help ship AI-driven marketing solutions, and I support my family's venture firm, where we manage $30M AUM and invest in early-stage tech across North America.
        </p>
        <p>
          On campus, I'm part of a self-driving car club (WEAP), working on autonomy and ML pipelines. I'm also taking a leadership program where I aim to launch an impact project by next year. Whether it's coding in Python, modeling in PyTorch, or cold-emailing LPs, I thrive at the edge of execution and ambition.
        </p>
        <p>
          My long-term vision is to build and exit a unicorn startup, then transition into building institutions: first scaling our venture fund to $100M+, and later helping shape public tech policy. I believe in solving real problems with clarity, speed, and soul. Also in building things that last far beyond the hype.
