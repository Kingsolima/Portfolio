          <p>
            This is my first project built using Next.js. It's a portfolio website designed to showcase
            all the projects I'm proud of. Each project page includes a video demo, description, 
            the challenges I faced, key takeaways, and tools used. You can also reach out to me through 
            various platforms (top right icons) or via the Contact Me page.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What Was Difficult</h2>
          <p>
            This was my first time working with Next.js, and getting used to the file-based routing and 
            server/client separation took some time. There was a learning curve, but it was worth it.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What I Learned</h2>
          <p>
            I've only scratched the surface of what's possible with Next.js. From static site generation 
            to API routes, this framework has so much to offerâ€”and I'm excited to keep exploring.
